Ones that are less efficient, everybody gets less value. Now the most efficient, so directly out of this we're going to get the overall efficient network  is going to be pairwise stable.\n",

Okay, that's wonderful.  it works well, but it, it, it could involve a lot of transfers.  It could involve a lot of spreading money around.

So, if somebody's not generating value,  other, other people don't subsidize that.
