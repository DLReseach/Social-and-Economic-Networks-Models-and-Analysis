    "So, what's going to happen is, if we  recognize a link, they don't, it doesn't want to be added but with a probability  epsilon it would be added. So, there's a probability of one third  epsilon that you would end up recognizing this link and adding it by accident.  There's a probability one third epsilon that you would move here.  And a probability one third epsilon that you would move in this direction.  So, from a network with zero links there is a probability of epsilon that you go  from zero links to one link. And there's a probability of one minus  epsilon that you'd just stay there. Okay?  And, and so forth. If we're here with two, two, with three  links. Then there's a probability epsilon that  you go from three to two and the probability of one minus epsilon that you  go from three back to three. And so forth, okay.  And so from, from one of these networks there's a one third times one minus  epsilon chance that you go to the complete network.  There's a one third chance times epsilon you go and delete a link that you wanted.  one third chance times epsilon here and so forth.  So, for each one of these things we can figure out what's the probability that  you move from a network with zero links to one with one.  From one with one, to two, and so forth. So instead of keeping track of all of the  networks, let's just keep track of them in terms of how many links they have. "

So there's a solution of how much time you spend in state zero, how much time  will you spend in state one and state two and state three.  So what's the average frequency of the number of periods you're going to spend  in each one of these things? That's a well defined Markov chain  problem. You look for the steady state  distribution. In this case it happens to be the left  hand side unit eigenvector of this matrix.  If you don't remember things on Markov chains or if you haven't seen Markov  chains before you can find detailed things on on the internet.  Also, I have some pages in my book that just goes through the basics of Markov  chains.

    "So what's the interesting thing about  this? Well the interesting thing about this.  Well, the interesting thing about this was we had two Pairwise Stable Nash  Networks. The empty network and the complete  network. And if you look at the amount of time  you're spending in each one of these things, as epsilon gets very, very small,  right, as epsilon goes to zero, this approaches one.  \n",

So, even though both of these were Pairwise Nash Stable.  This dynamic process is going to end up spending, as epsilon becomes very small,  most of its time in the three length network.  And so you can look at that by looking at the limit of this unique steady state  distribution. This is what's known as stochastic  stability in the game theory literature. It's a technique of, of refining  equilibria that has become quite powerful.  and Alison and I used this to, to, to develop methods of, of working through  dynamics in, in networks. And here it consists of prediction of  which network is going to be visited most often and stayed at for most of the time  in this process as epsilon becomes quite small.  And one thing to notice is that, as it's placing probability one here in the  limit. That's not the same, as the steady states  of the limit process. So if you actually look at the process  that had zero errors in it, you could have ended up in either the empty network  or the full network. So the steady states of the, of the limit  process, where you have no noise, is different than the limit of the process  with little bits of noise. So the little bits of noise here are very  important in making predictions\n",

    " So, if we suppose we're at at the network with three links.  Well, we can make an error. If we make an error and bounce to one of  these, so there's probably epsilon of that happening.  most likely it's going to come back. You would need two errors in order to get  to a point where you might get to to the other network, to the empty network,  right? So you'd have to, you'd have to make two  errors in a row before you could get to a point where you're going to find a  network which then naturally sort of has a tendency to lead back to the empty  network or the other Pairwise Nash Stable Network.  In contrast, one error on this network leads you to something which then leads  naturally to the, to this. So when you've got errors, it's much  harder in some sense that this stochastic stability notion means this is a more  stable, the full network is a more stable network.  It's harder to get away from that network.  And it's easier to, relatively easier, and it only takes one error to get away  from the empty network. And so, what this does is, is it begins  to look at what is known as basins of attraction.  When you look at these dynamic processes, this one has a larger basin of  attraction. If you get to any of these networks, you  can get back to this one. To get to this one you really can only  get there from, from a smaller set of states.  And as, as you begin to look at this, this process more naturally gives you a  complete network than a smaller one. So, this is a powerful tool for looking  at dynamics. you can simulate these things so once,  you know, this we can solve for explicitly with, with only three, three  nodes. And relatively small number of, of  networks. As you begin to enrich these kinds of  processes, they're going to get more complicated, but you can begin to analyze  them by simulation. So the "
