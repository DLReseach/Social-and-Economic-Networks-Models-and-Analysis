    \section{3.8 Estimating ERGMs}\label{estimating-ergms}

    \subsection{\texorpdfstring{Estimating \(P*\) /
ERGMs}{Estimating P* / ERGMs}}\label{estimating-p-ergms}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  we have the probability of a graph now depends on some set of
  statistics of the graph(\(S_k(g)\)) and multiplied by some
  parameters(\(\beta_k\))
\end{itemize}

\(Pr(g) = \frac{exp(\sum\beta_kS_k(g))}{\sum_{g'}exp(\sum\beta_kS_k(g'))}\)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{The power of such models}： we can put pretty much anything
  you want into those statistics. So if you wanted to keep track of
  links, triangles, you could make these based on covariates. So as we
  talked about in the block models, we could have links among blue
  nodes. And links among green nodes, links between blue and green
  nodes. Triangle involving blue, greens and yellows etc. So you could
  have all kinds of different statistics, keep track of those. And the
  idea, then, is that using this kind of model would allow us to test to
  see whether certain things are going to be significant or not. So are
  the parameters non-zero, are they positive, are they negative, what do
  they look like? That gives us some idea of how these different things
  matter in the formation of a graph.
\item
  \textbf{Weakness}: what's the difficulty, the challenge in these
  things is how are we going to estimate these?!
\end{itemize}

    \subsection{Example: Florentine
Marriages}\label{example-florentine-marriages}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Robins, Pattison, Kalish, Lusher(2007) fit an ERGM to Padgett and
  Ansel's Florentine data
\item
  Business ties between the 16 major families
\item
  Fit: \#links, two stars, three stars, trianles
\end{itemize}

We've got the probability of a graph depending on each one of these
things, then we can ask what do these different parameters look like?

\(Pr(g) = exp(\beta_1N_{links} + \beta_2N_{two stars} + \beta_3N_{three stars} + \beta_4N_{triangles} - c)\)

    \subsection{Example: Florentine Families Business
Dealings}\label{example-florentine-families-business-dealings}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{https://img0.ph.126.net/rBqaCiNW1_bm062TAnvV2w==/6631724174144834418.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

You can use \texttt{statnet}, for instance, which is a program package
in \textbf{R}, and you stick in your dataset and end up just directly
trying to fit an exponential random graph model. It asks which kinds of
things you want to throw in, and then it will spit out an answer.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{https://img2.ph.126.net/F-huNmYHHGy4cOCsUowGLA==/3886043528567843333.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

This example give us: - \textbf{one links}, we get a parameter of -4.27,
standard error for about 1.13, so this is statistically significantly
negative. So that's a network that doesn't like links. If we see the
graph "Business Only", it's a fairly sparse network, so networks that
have fewer links are going to be more probable under this model with the
negative parameter there. Networks that have lots of links would be less
probable. So it's not surprising that it gets a negative parameter here.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{two stars}, 1.09, like
\item
  \textbf{three stars}, -0.67, dislike
\item
  \textbf{triangles}, 1.32, like
\end{itemize}

Now exactly how we interpret those is a little complicated. It's
complicate by two facts, one, we're not quite sure the combinations of
these different things. So links are going to be inside two-stars,
inside three-stars, and so forth. We also haven't given us any theory of
exactly why the business dealing should have one type of structure or
another. So going at this with a social theory would then allow us to
make sense of these.

    \subsection{ERGMs}\label{ergms}

how these kinds of things are estimated and then what we should take
away from those estimates. So what's the challenge in estimating an
exponential random graph model?

\[Pr(g) = \frac{exp(\beta_1S_1(g) + ... + \beta_kS_k(g)}{\sum_{g'}exp(\beta_1S_1(g') + ... + \beta_kS_k(g'))}\]

So we put down our formulation, we've got a bunch of statistics, we want
to see if they matter and to what extent they matter positively or
negatively. And in order to make this a possibility, we had to sum over
all the possible graphs of what this can be, okay? So the idea is, how
likely graph g is depends on comparing it to how likely all the other
graphs would be in order to figure out why this one got picked out and
not any other one, okay?

So in order to go ahead and estimate this to figure out, for instance,
if we want to do what's known as \textbf{maximum likelihood estimation},
what we would want to do is let's pick the parameters that actually make
the given graph that we saw as probable as possible, okay? So which
parameters would make this probability as high as possible, okay? Well,
the difficulty is, in order to figure out which parameters maximize this
function, we have to be able to do this sum in the denominator, right?
And that's going to be tricky. Why is it going to be tricky? There's a
lot of ground graphs to sum over. And so, a techniques of instead of
actually doing an explicit calculation here, would be to try and
estimate this instead. And we'll estimate this, the standard the
technique, is using \textbf{MCMC, Markov chain Monte Carlo }techniques
for estimation.

And this is because we can popularize by Tom Snijders, and Mark
Handcock, who made some breakthroughs that allowed this to be applied to
exponential random graph models, and that's what underlies the software.
So instead of summing over all g primes, what we'll do is we'll sample
some g primes and then try and extrapolate and estimate that denominator
based on that. The program's a little more complicated, but essentially
what it's doing is walking the space and trying to pick out different g
primes and then based on that it can get a relative likelihood. And then
figure out, by searching across different parameters, which parameters
meet the highest likelihood of seeing the data we actually saw.

Note \(\sum_{g'}\) in
\[Pr(g) = \frac{exp(\beta_1S_1(g) + ... + \beta_kS_k(g)}{\sum_{g'}exp(\beta_1S_1(g') + ... + \beta_kS_k(g'))}\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Recall: n = 30 nodes, there are \(2^{30*(30-1)/2} = 2^{435}\) g's
  (less than \(2^{258}\) atoms in the universe...)
\item
  \textbf{Sampling g's will not lead to accurate estimates(not just MCMC
  limitation)}
\item
  MCMC estimation techniques are inaccurate:
\item
  Can one compute parameters?
\item
  Consistency of estimators of ERGMs:
\item
  When are parameters accurate and how many nodes are needed?
\item
  How to generate networks randomly?
\item
  Counterfactuals, validation...
\end{itemize}
