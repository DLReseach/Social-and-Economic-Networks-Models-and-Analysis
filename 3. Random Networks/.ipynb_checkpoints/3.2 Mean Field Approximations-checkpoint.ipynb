Let's go back and think again about simple Erdos-Renyi variation where now each node is born, forms m links at random to the existing ones. But we'll just smooth this out and do a continuous time approximation."

Well, this differential is expecting to gain m links over the time period, so there's t existing nodes, m new links being formed, so its chance of getting one of those is m/t. So it's gain per unit of time is going to be propotional to m/t.\n",
