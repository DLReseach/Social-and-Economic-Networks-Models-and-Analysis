    "\n",
    "One thing to emphasize just from the start is when we build models. We know that we're not going to try and capture everything in the world. And so realism is not usually a good reason for building a model to try and match reality. The reason that we build models, is to try and use as few moving parts as possible in order to reproduce the world. So the only reason we want to add this feature of growing random networks is not because that's the way the world is, but because this richer model might capture something in the real world that was not captured in the static models. So you shouldn't judge models based on realism, they're always wrong, the question is are they capturing reasonable elements and so here. "
