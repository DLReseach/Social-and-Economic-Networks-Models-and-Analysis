    "So, in terms of the static random network  models. why do we want to start with those?  for two reasons. One is that they'll going to be a very  useful benchmark. And again I've sort of emphasized this a  little bit before but I wanted to repeat it.  by, by looking at what would happen if things were just happening purely at  random then we can look at what we do observe and differentiate that from what  happens at random. or get some understanding of what, why it  has similar features to what happens at random.  So these benchmarks will tell us, you know, what component structures do we  expect to see at random? What kind of diameters do we see at  random? What kind of degree distributions do we  see at random? What kind of clustering might we see at  random? And so the, comparing things back to  those uniform at random models will allow us to, to do some comparisons.\n",

    "\n",
    " an important class of properties are what is known as monotone properties.  And so what is a monotone property? A monotone property is one such that if  some network satisfies that property and we add extra links.  So, we just increase the links in a network so that $g$ is a subset of the  links in $g′$, then $g′$ also satisfies the property. So it just means adding extra things  satisfies, keeps us satisfying a property. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - All three of the previous properties are monotone\n",
    "   \n",
    "So it just means adding extra things  satisfies, keeps us satisfying a property.  you can go back and check every one of the properties we just talked about is a monotone property. Now something that wouldn't be a monotone  property would be something like saying that there's an even number of links,  so if I add an extra link, now it turns  odd, it's no longer satisfying the property.  So there could be somethings such aren't going to be monotone.  But a lot of the properties you might be interested in so You know, it being  connected. Well if I had more links it's still  connected. so, you know, not having isolated nodes  if I add more links it doesn't have isolated nodes.  So that, that's a monotone property. That the path length is shorter than a  certain amount. If I add extra lengths it still has a  shorter path length. So these are nice properties that will be  easier to work with. they don't sort of blink on and off, as  we change the, the blink pattern. "

    "\n",
    " so what we'll be interested in then  is limiting properties. So one way to keep track of these  things is then to talk about large $n$, and then, so we can, for instance look at a  sequence of Erdos-Renyi Poisson, or G(n, p) random graphs, and then have some  probability, and then talk about what happens as a function of the size of the  graph. So this is one way of representing  properties, and now we can take a look at some of those properties, and understand  what might be true or not true, of those. one of the really nice things about the Erdos-Renyi  setting and the G(n, p) graphs, and part of the reason I think their work was so well  known is that there are very sharp thresholds for which properties do or  don't, are, aren't satisfied. So if we talk about how much does the  average degree have to be, the average degree, if it's above some level, then a  property will be sure, almost surely true as, as you get to large n, and if the degree is smaller than a certain level, it might not be true.  And so the idea here is that, that we'll have nice thresholds which will sharply  distinguish, when are properties true and when are properties not true, so we'll  take a look at that next.  "
