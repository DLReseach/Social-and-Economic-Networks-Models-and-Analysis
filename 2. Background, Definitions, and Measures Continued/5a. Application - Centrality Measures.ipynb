Now exactly what the causation here is we can tell stories, I can explain that it  probably has to do with communication and better connected friends leads to better  communication and so forth. Eigenvector centrality's picking that up.  but, you know, this is observational data, so we're not sure what the  causation is, but we do see that different.
