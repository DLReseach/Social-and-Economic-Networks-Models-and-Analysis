    " so the idea of how to describe a  position in a network you know, there's different aspects of individual  characteristics, some of which is how connected it is.  How clustered its friends are. distance to other nodes.  but more generally, trying to capture centrality, influence, and power are  going to build on specific definitions which, keep track of a  node's position. So, in terms of looking at nodes  centrality. the most basic measure in just trying to  figure out how important a node is, or how influential it is and so forth.  It's just how connected it is and that's captured directly by degree.  So degree captures some notion of connectedness of a node.  And you know, in order to make it a measure between zero and one, we can just  keep track of dividing through by `n - 1` the most possible links I could have  and then what fraction of people am I connected to compared to how many I could  be connected to. \n",
