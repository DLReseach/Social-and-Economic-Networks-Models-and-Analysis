    "# A Linear-Quadratic Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at one other game with continuum  of actions, so people can take a whole series of different actions, not just  zero or one. And this is going to be one with  compliments, strategic compliments, and it's a linear quadratic model, and so  it's got a very simple structure to the payoffs which allows for a simple, closed  form solution. \n",

    "- this comes out of a paper by Ballester  Calvo-Armengol and Zenou in 2006\n",

    "- **payoff**: $u_i(x_i, x_{-i}) = a x_i - b x_i^2/2 + \\sum_j w_{ij}x_ix_j$\n",

    "\n",
    "the structure of the game, that the  payoffs are very simple, and tractable. And so, in particular, when we think of a  given individual taking their action, Xi. Other actions are taking, other people  are taking actions X minus I, let's let xi be greater than or equal to zero, so  I'm taking some real valued action. And the utility that people get, we can  see why it's called linear quadratic, so, it's going to be increasing in my own  action, just linearly. And quadratically, there's going to be a  cost, so eventually I don't want to take too much action, because I'm going to pay  for that in terms of Xi squared. but there's also the strategic complement  aspect. So what I also do is I look at different  friends, and I weight them, so I have some weight I on, on J.  And what I get is some product of our actions.  So, if other individuals are taking really high actions, then that gives me  an incentive to take higher actions. I get a a payoff, a bonus, from taking  higher actions when people take high actions, okay?  So, the, the, the full model that they have allows also for some global  substitutes, and so forth. But let's focus in on this essential  aspect of the model. Which is the linear quadratic aspect.  Which is that I get a positive payoff from my direct action.  I get some negative cost and then which is quadratic, and then a bonus in terms  of what other individuals are doing in, in a strategic confluence.  Okay, so the nice thing about this is in this quadratic form it's going to be easy  to figure out how, what's my best action given what other people are doing.  And then to solve for nash equilibrium in this world is fairly easy.  We'll be able to find a set of, of, of actions such that everybody is best  responding to everybody else. We'll be able to solve that as a function  of the network in a really clean and simple form. \n",

    "Best response of $x_i$ to $x_{-i}$:\n",
    " - $x_{-i}$ is the vector of the actions for everybody else besides i. \n",
    " - if maximize the **payoff** equation with recpect to $x_i$, just take the derivative of this and set it equal to zero: $\\frac{du_i}{dx_i}=0$\n",
    "\n",
    "so : $a - b x_i + \\sum_j w_{ij}x_j = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_i = (a + \\sum_j w_{ij}x_j)/b$\n",
    " - So, the more activity your neighbors take  the more you want to take, okay. And so you are getting benefits that are  proportional to `a`, and benefits proportional to how much action your  neighbors are taking, and you pay a cost relative to `b`.  And so we get this benefits in the numerator over the cost and that  modulates exactly what they write $x_i$ is. so we've got a best response.  What I should do in response to everybody else is.  And then an equilibrium is going to be solving this set of equations  simultaneously so everybody wants to be taking the action response to everybody  else. \n",

    " - So, $x = (1 + B(g))(a/b)$. So in fact what we can say is the action that any individual taken one of these  linear quadratic games of complementarities is something which is  proportional to their Bonacich centrality.  So, higher Bonacich centrality, higher actions, okay.  So we've got everybody takes an action, A over B to begin with, which is just sort  of what they would in isolation with no network.  And then the extra network effect adds in these complementarities.  And how much extra action they get here depends on their Bonacich centrality in  the network.\n",
