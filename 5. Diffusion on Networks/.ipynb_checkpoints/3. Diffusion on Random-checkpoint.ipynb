    " - So in this kind of situation, ultimately what's really going to be important is when we think about a relationship or a link between two individuals, we should think of two people being related if one has a chance of passing something to the other in whatever our diffusion process is. So if we're thinking about the flu, then we would think about, okay, I'd be connected to all the individuals who I might infect, and so that might be a very broad range of individuals. \n",
    " - Whereas, if we're thinking about a political view or some new technology that I might tell somebody about, it might be a much narrower set of individuals who we might have that kind of interaction. So, nodes are going to be linked if one would infect the other. And one substantial simplification we're going to make to begin with is that this is going to be sort of an independent and identical probability across links. So, each person has an equal chance of infecting any one of their neighbors. Whereas, that might not be true in reality where you might spend more time interacting with some individuals than others, and have more of a chance of a diffusion process proceeding across some links than others. So, we'll define the links by the interactions that are necessary for diffusion. \n",
