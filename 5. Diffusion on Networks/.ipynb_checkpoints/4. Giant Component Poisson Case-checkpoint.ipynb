You can do a more exact calculation using generating functions. There's some of that in the book, but this will give us a fairly good approximation and work fairly well especially on large networks\n",

    "We get these Tyche phase transitions, so if expected neighbors less than \"1\" expected interactions that would transmit a diffusion of less than \"1\", we don't get diffusion. Once you hit one we get a diffusion and then it grows fairly rapidly and by the time you have three interactions then we're already to the point where you're very likely to hit most of the population. So if you remember in our promo video I said tell at least two friends. Well, if you tell just one friend about this then we don't get much diffusion. Two friends is at least enough to start pushing us fairly far along this. And you get to three friends and you're most of the way there. \n",
    "\n",
    "So just in terms of giant component size here we are. We see that there's a fairly tight transition from having no giant component to having almost everybody being connected and so most of the play is in this one region. And indeed when people study epidemiology there's this idea that having at least one contact that's going to transmit something if people are doing more than one you're going to get diffusion or contagions and if people are having less than one transmission then things are going to die out. And that makes perfect sense. You need at least, you know, more than one and it's growing, fewer than one and it's shrinking. That's the critical point. And then here we find that it actually transitions very rapidly so that by the time you've got three interactions that are likely to lead to contagion then our diffusion is quite extensive."
