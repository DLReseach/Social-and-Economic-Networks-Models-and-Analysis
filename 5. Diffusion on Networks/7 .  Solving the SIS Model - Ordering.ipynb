    " - $\\rho$ in the population is the acutally average, if we take expectations over all degrees, so the higher people are going to be infected at higher rates, so when you're meeting them at higher values that means that people you're going to meet are more infected, but if we're somebody who just cares about the average level in the population, so if I'm a government and I care about how infected my population is, **ultimatly what I care about is what $\\rho$ is, not what $\\theta$ is**, so $\\theta$ is very important in determining what the steady state is going to be, but the thing I might be interested in terms of my policies is what fraction of my population ends up being infected   \n",

    "- Theorem JR(2007): If $P'$ is a mean preserving spread of P, then the highest steady state $\\theta' > \\theta$, but the corresponding $\\rho' > \\rho$ if $\\lambda$ is low, while $\\rho' < \\rho$ if $\\lambda$ is high.\n",
    " - what's the intuition behind this? The intuition is that in situations where $\\lambda$ is very high, the high interaction nodes are already going to be very infected. And so, actually increasing, in putting weight on higher degrees isn't going to matter that much because those nodes are going to be infected at such a high rate that they're going to already be infected. And so you're not changing that much but putting more weight on low degree nodes can actually decrease the, so now you've got some people who have very few interactions. Those people can actually end up being infected with lower rates. So, the actual overall infection rate in the society can be balanced by the fact that you are increasing some of the higher degree nodes but those people are already going to be infected even without this increase and the low degree nodes as you move them towards lower part they can actually end up with lower infection rates and so that counterbalances it. So, when you average across the population, not with the relative frequency of meetings, you actually end up with a decrease in the overall rate."

    "Now we, more generally what we'd have to do if we start to work with things where the network architecture is given, then it's going to be more important to use simulations and so forth. So, we did some calculations before where we talked about component science and so forth and that gives us some insights. But, more generally if we actually want to study these processes a lot of it's going to be done by simulation. So, if you give me a particular network and ask what's going to happen on it then I might have to write down a program and actually simulate what's going to happen there. So, the next thing we'll look at is a simple model of diffusion where we'll do some calculations and just simulate that model and see exactly how it works and that will allow us to actually fit something directly to data. And there's a large amount of that that goes on in epidemiology and marketing and other kinds of areas where you're trying to make predictions. If you know something about the network you're working with you can actually simulate things and that's going to go a long way towards improving your accuracy. So, the SIS model gives us nicer intuitions, simple ideas, but it's not one you're going to easily take to data. We're going to have to enrich the model to fit it to networks. And that's what we'll talk about next. "
