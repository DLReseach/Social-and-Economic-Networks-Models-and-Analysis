    "- An extensively studied model in epidemiology\n",
    " -  So, the idea here is you can recover. So you can catch something you become infected so, you're susceptible, you could catch it.  You get it, then you recover and this is something which you catch overtime, so it  might me something that I erase a virus from my computer, I'm susceptible again. And I can catch em when new one comes, I  catch it again, I erase it and so forth. So, I go back and forth from this process of you know, realizing that I have a virus, getting rid of it, and then catching it again later in time. \n",
