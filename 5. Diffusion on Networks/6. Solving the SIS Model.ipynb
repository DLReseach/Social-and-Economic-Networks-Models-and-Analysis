So in a situation where we keep $E[d]$ constant and increase $E[d^2]$, then we're going to be in a situation where basically, what we're doing is spreading out the degrees, but that makes higher degree nodes, which are going to serve as hubs and be conduits for infection and that aids in the spread of the infection, and allows us to have a steady state that's non-zero."
