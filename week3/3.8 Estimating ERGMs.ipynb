    "- **The power of such models**ï¼š we can put pretty much anything you want into those statistics. So if you wanted to keep track of links, triangles, you could make these based on covariates. So as we talked about in the block models, we could have links among blue nodes. And links among green nodes, links between blue and green nodes. Triangle involving blue, greens and yellows etc. So you could have all kinds of different statistics, keep track of those. And the idea, then, is that using this kind of model would allow us to test to see whether certain things are going to be significant or not. So are the parameters non-zero, are they positive, are they negative, what do they look like? That gives us some idea of how these different things matter in the formation of a graph. \n",

    "- **one links**, we get a parameter of -4.27, standard error for about 1.13, so this is statistically significantly negative. So that's a network that doesn't like links. If we see the graph \"Business Only\", it's a fairly sparse network, so networks that have fewer links are going to be more probable under this model with the negative parameter there. Networks that have lots of links would be less probable. So it's not surprising that it gets a negative parameter here.\n",

    "Now exactly how we interpret those is a little complicated.  It's complicate by two facts, one, we're not quite sure the combinations of these different things. So links are going to be inside two-stars, inside three-stars, and so forth. We also haven't given us any theory of exactly why the business dealing should have one type of structure or another. So going at this with a social theory would then allow us to make sense of these."

    "So we put down our formulation, we've got a bunch of statistics, we want to see if they matter and to what extent they matter positively or negatively. And in order to make this a possibility, we had to sum over all the possible graphs of what this can be, okay? So the idea is, how likely graph g is depends on comparing it to how likely all the other graphs would be in order to figure out why this one got picked out and not any other one, okay? \n",
    "\n",
    "So in order to go ahead and estimate this to figure out, for instance, if we want to do what's known as **maximum likelihood estimation**, what we would want to do is let's pick the parameters that actually make the given graph that we saw as probable as possible, okay? So which parameters would make this probability as high as possible, okay? Well, the difficulty is, in order to figure out which parameters maximize this function, we have to be able to do this sum in the denominator, right? And that's going to be tricky. Why is it going to be tricky? There's a lot of ground graphs to sum over. And so, a techniques of instead of actually doing an explicit calculation here, would be to try and estimate this instead. And we'll estimate this, the standard the technique, is using **MCMC, Markov chain Monte Carlo **techniques for estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is because we can popularize by Tom Snijders, and Mark Handcock, who made some breakthroughs that allowed this to be applied to exponential random graph models, and that's what underlies the software. So instead of summing over all g primes, what we'll do is we'll sample some g primes and then try and extrapolate and estimate that denominator based on that. The program's a little more complicated, but essentially what it's doing is walking the space and trying to pick out different g primes and then based on that it can get a relative likelihood. And then figure out, by searching across different parameters, which parameters meet the highest likelihood of seeing the data we actually saw. "
