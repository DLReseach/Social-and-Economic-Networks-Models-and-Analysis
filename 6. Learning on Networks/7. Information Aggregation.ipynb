    " - let's suppose that  we were doing some influences. Whatever those influences are, so society  n has a vector s1, through sn. So we look at those.  We'll call those the $s_i^n$'s. All right.  So in society n, you've got an $s_1$ through $s_n$, then we have a different one for when  we add this extra person. So each one of these societies has a  vector. the Weak Law of Large Numbers tells us  that if we look at averaging those error. So what's going to happen is the  influence is going to capture how much of each persons error enters into the  overall societal error. The sum of the weights on those errors is  going to be 0. If and only if the largest influence that  anybody has goes to 0. So if anybody retains influence, then  what we're going to do is end up retaining weight on that person's error.  Their believe is going to be a non-trivial part of the overall society's  belief. And so, it's going to be necessary that  everybody have a negligible weight in the limit.  So as society aggregates, they have to disperse so that we're putting weight on  different individuals. If we keep all listening to the same  person, we're going to have inaccuracy. And, actually that's going to be enough,  so as long as society spreads it out, given everybody has finite variance,  averaging a bunch of these variables will give us a good answer. \n",
